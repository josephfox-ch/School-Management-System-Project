Welcome to the School Management System Project, a coding challenge that marks a significant milestone in your journey with us at Hi-Coders! This project is designed to put your web development skills to the test and integrate the knowledge you've gained in CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

## Project Overview

- Develop an interactive application for managing students, classes, and teachers.
- Optional feature: Implement a grades view for additional functionality.
- Sort and filter data to enhance user experience.
- Utilize CSS3+, HTML5+, and ES6+ for modern browser support.
- Maintain clean separation of structure (HTML), logic (JS), and presentation (CSS).
- Store data using the local storage API.

## Technical Limitations

- No SPA frameworks like Angular or React.
- CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap are allowed.
- Layouts should rely on Flexbox or Grid.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Ensure the application can display, edit, delete, and create students, classes, and teachers. Optionally, provide a grades view and sort/filter functionality.
- **JavaScript Quality:** Avoid console clutter with no logs or commented-out code. Prevent global namespace pollution.
- **CSS Quality:** Avoid unnecessary classes or IDs; select elements based on structure or name. Eliminate inline styles.
- **HTML Quality:** Use semantic HTML elements appropriately, and ensure your HTML passes validation.
- **Code Standards:** Follow the DRY Principle, methodology, naming, and separation standards. Maintain a clear project file and folder structure.
